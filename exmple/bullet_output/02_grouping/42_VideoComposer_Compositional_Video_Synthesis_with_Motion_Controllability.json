          "text": "The pursuit of controllability as a higher standard of visual content creation has yielded remarkable progress in customizable image synthesis. However, achieving controllable video synthesis remains challenging due to the large variation of temporal dynamics and the requirement of cross-frame temporal consistency. Based on the paradigm of compositional generation, this work presents VideoComposer that allows users to flexibly compose a video with textual conditions, spatial conditions, and more importantly temporal conditions. Specifically, considering the characteristic of video data, we introduce the motion vector from compressed videos as an explicit control signal to provide guidance regarding temporal dynamics. In addition, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Condition encoder (STC-encoder) that serves as a unified interface to effectively incorporate the spatial and temporal relations of sequential inputs, with which the model could make better use of temporal conditions and hence achieve higher inter-frame consistency. Extensive experimental results suggest that VideoComposer is able to control the spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously within a synthesized video in various forms, such as text description, sketch sequence, reference video, or even simply hand-crafted motions. The code and models are publicly available at https://videocomposer.github.io.",

          "text": "Above observations motivate the proposed VideoComposer, which equips video synthesis with improved controllability in both spatial and temporal perception. For this purpose, we decompose a video into three kinds of representative factors, i.e., textual condition, spatial conditions and the crucial temporal conditions, and then train a latent diffusion model to recompose the input video conditioned by them. In particular, we introduce the video-specific motion vector as a kind of temporal guidance during video synthesis to explicitly capture the inter-frame dynamics, thereby providing direct control over the internal motions. To ensure temporal consistency, we additionally present a unified STC-encoder that captures the spatio-temporal relations within sequential input utilizing cross-frame attention mechanisms, leading to an enhanced cross-frame consistency of the output videos. Moreover, STC-encoder serves as an interface that allows for efficient and unified utilization of the control signals from various condition sequences. As a result, VideoComposer is capable of flexibly composing a video with diverse conditions while simultaneously maintaining the synthesis quality, as shown in Fig. 1. Notably, we can even control the motion patterns with simple hand-crafted motions, such as an arrow indicating the moon's trajectory in Fig. 1d, a feat that is nearly impossible with current methods. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of VideoComposer through extensive qualitative and quantitative results, and achieve exceptional creativity in the various downstream generative tasks.",

Recently, research efforts on image synthesis have shifted from utilizing GANs [18], VAEs [31], and flow models [14] to diffusion models [9, 19, 23, 32, 34, 54, 59, 74, 80, 81] due to more stable training, enhanced sample quality, and increased flexibility in a conditional generation. Regarding image generation, notable works such as DALL-E 2 [46] and GLIDE [40] employ diffusion models for text-to-image generation by conducting the diffusion process in pixel space, guided by CLIP [44] or classifier-free approaches. Imagen [50] introduces generic large language models, i.e., T5 [45], improving sample fidelity. The pioneering work LDMs [48] uses an autoencoder [15] to reduce pixel-level redundancy, making LDMs computationally efficient. Regarding image editing, pix2pix-zero [42] and prompt-to-prompt editing [21] follow instructional texts by manipulating cross-attention maps. Imagic [29] interpolates between an optimized embedding and the target embedding derived from text instructions to manipulate images. DiffEdit [11] introduces automatically generated masks to assist text-driven image editing. To enable conditional synthesis with flexible input, ControlNet [79] and T2I-Adapter [38] incorporate a specific spatial condition into the model, providing more fine-grained control. One milestone,Composer [28], trains a multi-condition diffusion model that broadly expands the control space and displays remarkable results. Nonetheless, this compositionality has not yet been proven effective in video synthesis, and VideoComposer aims to fill this gap.",

Recent research has demonstrated the potential of employing diffusion models for high-quality video synthesis [5, 20, 25, 30, 36, 62, 75]. Notably,ImagenVideo [24] and Make-A-Video [53] both model the video distribution in pixel space, which limits their applicability due to high computational demands. In contrast, MagicVideo [83] models the video distribution in the latent space, following the paradigm of LDMs [48], significantly reducing computational overhead. With the goal of editing videos guided by texts, VideoP2P [33] and vid2vid-zero [66] manipulate the crossattention map, while Dreamix [37] proposes an image-video mixed fine-tuning strategy. However, their generation or editing processes solely rely on text-based instructions [44, 45]. A subsequent work, Gen-1 [16], integrates depth maps alongside texts using cross-attention mechanisms to provide structural guidance. Both MCDiff [8] and LaMD [27] target motion-guided video generation; the former focuses on generating human action videos and encodes the dynamics by tracking the keypoints and reference points, while the latter employs a learnable motion latent to improve quality. Nevertheless, incorporating the guidance from efficient motion vectors or incorporating multiple guiding conditions within a single model is seldom explored in the general video synthesis field.",
